	<h1>A grim half-century</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
		FOR Europe, as Ian Kershaw notes in this magisterial history, 
		which came out in Britain in September and is just being published in America, the 20th century was a game of two halves. 
		The first saw a cataclysm that brought down empires, plunged the continent into a deep slump and culminated in the horrors of the second world war. 
		At least for Western Europe, the second was, in contrast, a triumph of peace and prosperity. 
		That distinction may explain why Mr Kershaw has sensibly divided his original assignment to write the 20th-century volume in the Penguin “History of Europe”
		series into two books, of which this is the first.

			对欧洲而言，正如伊恩·科修在这部已于9月份在英国上市、目前正在美国印刷的权威史中所言，20世纪是一场上下半场的博弈。
			上半场看到的一场带来了多个帝国崩溃、令这块大陆陷入了一场深度衰退、最后在第二次世界大战的恐怖中达到了高潮的灾难。
			与之相比，下半场，至少对西欧来说，是一场和平与繁荣的胜利。这种对比可能正是科修明智地将其为企鹅“欧洲史”丛书撰写20世纪卷的最初打算分解为了上下两册的原因。此书为上册。
